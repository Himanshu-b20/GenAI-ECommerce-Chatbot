# ü§ñ E-Commerce AI Chatbot (with Semantic Routing + Groq Cloud + LLaMA 3.3 70B)
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built for e-commerce platforms to automate and enhance customer interactions. It can handle FAQs, product-related queries, and casual small talk using a semantic routing system combined with a high-performance large language model (LLM).

## üîç How It Works
**Semantic Routing (using sentence transformer) :**
 Incoming user messages are semantically analyzed and classified into three categories:
- FAQs (e.g., "What‚Äôs the return policy?")
- Product Queries (e.g., "All Nike shoes with rating higher than 4.8")
- Small Talk (e.g., "Hey, whats your name?")

This classification ensures that each query type is handled with the right logic and context.

**LLM-Powered Responses via Groq :**
 Once routed, the query is sent to Groq Cloud, using Meta's LLaMA-3.3-70B-Versatile model for generating fast, accurate, and context-aware responses. Groq‚Äôs ultra-low-latency architecture enables real-time conversations at scale.
